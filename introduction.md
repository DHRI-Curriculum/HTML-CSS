# Introduction

Websites seems like these magical things that appear when we open our web browsers. We can click between different pages of the website to obtain different information about the 'thing' the website is providing information about. What may be less obvious about websites is that, in essence **websites are interlinked text documents** usually written in HTML or another web-based markup language (for example, XML, XHTML). 

*Fun fact: Nearly 80% of all websites (whose markup language we know) use HTML.*

**HTML** is a markup language used to write web-based documents. It's used to designate `elements` in documents, such as paragraphs, images, headings, and links, so that they can be rendered by programs such as browsers. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.



**CSS** is a language for describing style in markup languages, and is usually used in conjunction with HTML. CSS is essentially a set of rules that can then be applied when rendering a HTML document. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which refers to the fact that there is an order of precedence in how CSS rules are applied to a document.

Together, these languages can be used to write and style a website using a text editor (i.e. Sublime) on your computer. 


In essence, websites are interlinked text files.
