# Introduction

Websites seems like these magical things that appear when we open our web browsers. We can click between different pages of the website to obtain different information about the 'thing' the website is providing information about. What may be less obvious about websites is that, in essence **websites are interlinked text documents** usually written in HTML or another web-based markup language (for example, XML, XHTML). 

*Fun fact*: **Nearly 80% of all websites (whose markup language we know) use HTML.**

<h2> HTML, aka Hypertext Markup Language </h2>
HTML is a markup language used to write web-based documents. It's used to designate `elements` in documents, such as paragraphs, images, headings, and links, so that they can be rendered by programs such as browsers. 

<h2> Markup language vs. Programming Language </h2>
HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, and functionally and conceptually there is a difference. Whereas programming languages are used to transform data - by creating scripts that organize an output of data based on a particular input of data, a markup language is used to control the presentation of data. 

For a practical example of this difference we can think about tables. A programming language can help you search through a table, understand the kinds of data the table includes, find particular data points, or transform its content into other kinds of data like frequencies. A markup language will help you create and arrange the table and add content to it.

A common way to refer to the differences between a programming language and a markup language is that the former is *interpreted* while the latter is *compiled*.

<h2> CSS, aka Cascading Stylesheet </h2>
CSS is a language for describing style in markup languages, and is usually used in conjunction with HTML. CSS is essentially a set of rules that can then be applied when rendering a HTML document. It's name - cascading stylesheets - refers to the fact that there is an order of precedence in how CSS rules are applied to a document; in short, more specific rules overwrite less specific rules.

<h2> Where does the Internet come in? </h2>
Together, these languages can be used to write and style a website using a text editor (i.e. Sublime) directly from your computer. No Internet access needed.

However, Internet access is necessary if you plan on making your website available to the public. At the end of this workshop, we will briefly disucss how to get your website from your local computer on the internet.
