# Theory to Practice

## Suggested Further Readings

### Platforms

- ["What is a CMS?"](https://darc.gcdiprojects.org/What_is_a_CMS%3F), _DARC Wiki_, Digital Archives Research Collective. 

This entry from the DARC wiki introduces the concept of a Content Management System (CMS), which refers to a suite of tools that facilitates easy website development as well as hosting on the internet. Most modern-day websites require functionalities that strains the limits of HTML and CSS. Content Management Systems allow users without much familiarity with advanced web-design languages and concepts to quickly build websites that are visually appealing and contain a variety of features.   

- [“Choosing a Platform for Your Project Website”](http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/blog/13/12/04/choosing-platform-your-project-website), Digital Humanities at Berkeley.

This post provides a thicker description of Content Management Systems. It raises factors such as functionality, familiarity, community, support, and cost when choosing a particular platform on which to build a website.

### Theories

- Vincent Brown, [“Mapping a Slave Revolt: Visualizing Spatial History through the Archives of Slavery”](https://doi.org/10.1215/01642472-3315826) _Social Text_ 33, no. 4 125 (2015): 134–41.

This is a scholarly article that provides insight into how websites are used as digital humanities research tools. In this article, Vincent Brown describes the [_Slave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760–1761: A Cartographic Narrative_](http://revolt.axismaps.com/) project, a digital archive and interactive map of Tacky's Rebellion. The article explores the potential of the digital in enabling a "rhetorical practice that can define, clarify, and advocate visions of the world that might otherwise go unarticulated."  

- Elizabeth Maddock Dillon, [“By Design: Remapping the Colonial Archive”](https://doi.org/10.1215/01642472-3315838), _Social Text_ 33, no. 4 125 (2015): 142–147.

This scholarly article also discusses the [_Slave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760–1761: A Cartographic Narrative_](http://revolt.axismaps.com/) project, a digital archive and interactive map of Tacky's Rebellion. Elizabeth Maddock Dillon argues for the centrality of the question of design in building websites. Dillon underscores the importance of thoughtful attention to the arrangement of imagery and text, the choice of iconography used to express information, and the form of data visualizations when creating online digital humanities projects.

## Other Tutorials

- [Omeka](https://www.omeka.net/) is a platform for building digital archives and digital exhibits. It is designed to help those without deep technical knowledge build simple interactive websites. Instead of using HTML and CSS, Omeka provides a [Graphical User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) for building websites. Omeka is a wonderful point of beginning to understand how a content management system works. Graduate Center Digital Fellow and digital archivist, Stefano Morello, has put together a very helpful workshop on [getting started with Omeka](https://github.com/GCDigitalFellows/omeka).

- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) is the most widely used content management service. Similar to Omeka, it provides a Graphical User Interface for building websites. However, unlike Omeka, Wordpress provides many additional functionalities that vary in their use, scale, and complexity. Wordpress can be used to make a variety of different kinds of websites, from course-websites to scholarly publications, and much more. The [Wordpress Turorial for Beginners](https://wordpress.com/learn/) provides a helpful introduction to this tool. 

- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) can be useful to more advanced users for hosting HTML/CSS files and publishing them directly on the internet. It draws on a Github repository to build static websites. Websites that are hosted on Github pages tend to have a URL that ends in `github.io`. The official Github documentation has a well written guide on [creating a Github Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).


## Projects or Challenges to Try

### Build a Course Website

This project is designed to help you practice the HTML/CSS fundamentals covered in this workshop. The goal of this project will be to create a locally-hosted course website using HTML and CSS that contains the following:

- Course Description 
- Readings
- Schedule of Classes
- Assignments
- Instructor's Contact Details and Office Hours
- Menu that allows users to navigate the different sections of the website.

You are free to decide how this information is presented and styled in your website. You could put all of the information in a single page. Alternatively, you might consider making different pages for each aspect of the course website. However, as you develop your website, be sure to make sure that you cover the following key aspects of thoughtful website design:

- Make sure that all links are correctly formatted and point in the right direction.
- Be sure to include alt-text with all images.
- Ensure that your use of color, font, and images facilitates ease of access. 

To begin, create a folder called "courseWebsite" in your working directory. This folder will contain your index.html file, any other HTML files you create, any CSS files you use to style your website, and images that you would like to use in your Course Website. Now its time start using elements, attributes, classes, IDs, and all the other aspects of HTML and CSS to start building your website!

If you are unsure of which HTML/CSS commands to use, check out the [HTML Cheat Sheet](http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/cheatsheet.php) and the [CSS Cheat Sheet](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/15sp/cheat-sheets/css-cheat-sheet.pdf), which provides a quick reference guide.


## Discussion Questions

- In this workshop, we have focused on the fundametals of HTML and CSS. The point was to provide an introduction to the workings of websites. In practice, however, the websites that we desire to build will have complex use cases. What are some websites that you imagine building? What kinds of interactive features would you like to have in your website?

- Some websites provide information clearly and in an enaging manner. Others might inundate with a barrage of content that leaves one mystified. What would you say are some of the characteristics of well-designed websites? Which websites do you consider a joy to use? What design elements (such as font, color, layout, and menus) stand out to you as being particularly important in making good websites?
