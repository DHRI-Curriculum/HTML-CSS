#Ordering

## IMPORTANT
With CSS the **more specific rules always take precedent**. This underlying rule applies to CSS in your external sheet, as well as to CSS that might integrated into your HTML in different ways (i.e. external vs. internal vs. inline). 

If you link to an external stylesheet, and you add inline or internal CSS into your HTML, the inline or internal CSS will override the rules set in the external stylesheet. If you use inline and internal CSS at the same time, the inline CSS will override the internal CSS.
