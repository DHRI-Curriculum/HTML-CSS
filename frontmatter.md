## Abstract

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create and organize the content of a website. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for website design and layout. Together, these languages form the foundation of what one needs to know to create websites that are useful and well-designed. This workshop walks participants through the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. The purpose of this website is to help participants understand the rudiments of websites, with the intention of providing a strong base of knowledge from which to imagine web-based digital humanities projects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will learn how to:

- Familiarize yourself with the anatomy of a webpage and how the Internet works.
- Understand the basics of the HTML and CSS markup languages.    
- Use HTML, CSS, and a text editor to build a small locally-hosted website.    
    
## Estimated time

10 hours.

## Prerequisites

This workshop makes reference to concepts from the Command Line workshop. In particular, we make use of the Command Line to create new folders and files, as well as to move along the file directory. Completing the Command Line workshop will make participants more comfortable with working with HTML / CSS.  

## Contexts

### Pre-reading suggestions

- [Digital History: A Guide To Gathering, Preserving, and Presenting the Past on the Web](http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/) by Daniel J. Cohen and Roy Rosenzweig provides clear introduction to what a life-cycle of web-based digital humanities project might look like. The book covers a variety of aspects of a website project from initial planning, to website design, and even cultivating an audience. Participants are welcome to read as much of this free online book as suits them. I highly recommend reading the [introduction](http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/introduction/) which helpfully explains the affordances and difficulties of web-based digital projects.

### Projects that use these skills

HTML and CSS are fundamental to building websites. Some projects that use HTML and CSS include:
- [Digital Humanities Research Institute](https://www.dhinstitutes.org/)
- [Colored Conventions](https://coloredconventions.org/)
- [Musical Passage](http://www.musicalpassage.org/)

### Ethical Considerations

Building websites can involve making information public on the internet, which raises a host of intellectual property legal concerns. It is very important to make sure that you prominently declare which creative commons licenses you are using for your website so that visitors to your website are aware of the ways in which they can use the information that you are providing. Learn more about choosing the appropriate creative commons license here on [the Creative Commons website](https://creativecommons.org/choose/). Similarly, if your website uses images, videos, or any kind of document from other sources (like archives, artists, newspapers, etc.) you must be sure to cite these sources and make sure that you have the necessary permissions to reproduce these works.

Creating websites also involves making sure that it is designed to be accessible for those with disabilities. If your website displays images, then each image should also contain [alt text](https://accessibility.psu.edu/images/alttext/) metadata that describes the image such that it is usable for screenreaders. Screenreaders make websites accessible for those with visual and/or auditory disabilities. Similarly, if your website involves showcasing audio-based information (like interviews or lectures) then you should provide a transcription of the audio. We will go over basic practices of making websites accessbile in this workshop. You can learn more about accessibility standards and guidelines at the [W3C's page on Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility). Furthermore, there are also services like the [WAVE tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) that help identify ways of making websites more accessible.
