## Abstract

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create and organize the content of a website. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used for design and layout. Together, these languages form the foundation of what one needs to know to create websites that are useful and well-designed.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

- Familiarize themselves with the anatomy of a webpage and how the Internet works.
- Understand the basics of the HTML and CSS markup languages.    
- Use HTML, CSS, and a text editor to build a small website.    
    
## Estimated time

10 hours.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites required for learning HTML/CSS. However, your website can be enhanced by incorporating other languages like javascript, python, SQL, git, and jekyll, among others. 

## Contexts

### Pre-reading suggestions

- "Understanding Web Pages and HTML" on Programming Historian (https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/viewing-html-files)
- "How to build a responsive website from start to finish" on DevTips (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?annotation_id=annotation_698551941&feature=iv&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KQZUkRjfwMmTq_f1fbxerI&src_vid=WX0MpDuUqqw)

### Projects that use these skills

HTML and CSS are fundamental to building websites. Some projects that use HTML and CSS include:
- Digital Humanities Research Institute (https://www.dhinstitutes.org/)
- Colored Conventions (https://coloredconventions.org/)
- Musical Passages (http://www.musicalpassage.org/)

### Ethical Considerations

Building websites can involve making information public on the internet, which raises a host of intellectual property legal concerns. It is very important to make sure that you prominently declare which creative commons licenses you are using for your website so that visitors to your website are aware of the ways in which they can use the information that you are providing. Learn more about choosing the appropriate creative commons license here: (https://creativecommons.org/choose/)

Another ethical concern when using HTML/CSS to build websites is to correctly acknowledge the labor of all those who have been involved in building the website and gathering the information that it contains. These acknowledgements are usually listed in the website's "about" page.

Creating websites also involves making sure that it is designed to be accessible for those with visual and/or auditory disabilities. If your website displays images, then each image should also contain "alt text" metadata that describes the image such that it is usable for screenreaders. Similarly, if your website involves showcasing audio-based information (like interviews or lectures) then you should provide a transcription of the audio.
