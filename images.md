# Images

Images are another important component of websites. Sometimes these just help bring your website to life, but other times images are critical for communicating information to visitors. 

Images are created with the `<img>` tag. Similar to the `<a>` tag, `<img>` requires an attribute, in this case `src`, which communicates secondary information to your browser that tells it where the image is located. The `src` attribute stands for source. 

The following sequence is telling your browser to pull in an image located in the same folder as the doc: 

	<img src="scream.jpeg"/>

## ACTIVITY:
Download and save an image from the web, or move an image from your computer into the same folder as your 'index.html' file. Tip: Give the file a simple name. 

Using the code above as a reference, add that image into your `index.html` file, re-save the file, and re-open or refresh the page in your browser. 

#### Challenge: 
Looking at the code in your `index.html` file, what type of tag is the `<img>` tag? 

Hint: Compare this tag with your `<p>` tag.
