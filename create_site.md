#  ACTIVITY: Create a Course Site!

Using the tags we've just reviewed, and two additional ones (see below) begin creating an introductory page for a course you teach. 

The first step is creating a new page. Call this page `Course.html` and remember the conditions of where to save it.

## You page should include the following:
<p>
    <ul>
        <li> Doctype </li>
        <li> Root element </li>
        <li> Head and a body </li>
        <li> Title for the page </li>
        <li> One heading </li>
        <li> One paragraph </li>
        <li> One image </li>
        <li> A menu or navigation bar that links to your `Home` and `About` pages </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Think about the order of your content as you assemble the body of your page.</strong> 
</p>
<br/>

## Additional Tags
Here are two additional tags that might come in handy in assembling your page:
<p>
    <ul>
        <li> To make a list. This may come in handy when making your menu or navigation bar. </li>
    </ul>
</p>
```
<p>
    <ul>
        <li> item 1 </li>
        <li> item 2 </li>
        <li> item 3 </li>
    </ul>
</p>
```

<p>
    <ul>
        <li> To make a line break or give space between different elements. </li>
    </ul>
</p>
```
<br/>
```
<br/>  
<br/>
## CHALLENGE
