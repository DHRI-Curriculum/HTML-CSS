#  ACTIVITY: Create an Institute Site!

Using the tags we've just reviewed, and two additional ones (see below) begin creating an introductory page for your future institute. 

On your desktop, create a new folder called `Institute_Site`. 

Create a `index.html` file inside that folder. This will be the homepage or landing page of your site. 

## This page should include the following:
<p>
    <ul>
        <li> Doctype </li>
        <li> Root element </li>
        <li> Head and a body </li>
        <li> Title for the page </li>
        <li> One heading </li>
        <li> One paragraph </li>
        <li> One image </li>
        <li> A menu or navigation bar that links to your `Home` and `About` pages </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Think about the order of your content as you assemble the body of your page.</strong> 
</p>

Don't worry about getting the content just write, as much as using this to review the structure of a webpage, and practice the creating a webpage. 

## Additional Tags
Here are two additional tags that might come in handy in assembling your page:
<p>
    <ul>
        <li> To make a list. This may come in handy when making your menu or navigation bar. </li>
    </ul>
</p>

```
<p>
    <ul>
        <li> item 1 </li>
        <li> item 2 </li>
        <li> item 3 </li>
    </ul>
</p>
```

<p>
    <ul>
        <li> To make a line break or give space between different elements. </li>
    </ul>
</p>

```
<br/>
```
