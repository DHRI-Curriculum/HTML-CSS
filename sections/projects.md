# Projects

One important website-building project where you'll be applying these skills is creating your DH Institute website. In thinking about what your site may look like, you can examine our website for this institute [(dhinstitutes.org)](http://dhinstitutes.org/). This site uses a software called Jekyll (which you'll be learning about on Monday) to coordiate HTML and CSS text files. Examine the code by opening your secondary menu and selecting 'View Page Source', the same way we did for the [opening activity](opening_activity.md).
