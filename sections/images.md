# Images

Images are another important component of websites. Sometimes these just help bring your website to life, but other times they can help communicate information to users. 

**Challenge:** What type of tag is the `<img>` tag? *Hint: Compare this tag with your `<p>` tag.*

Images are created with the `<img>` tag. Similar to the `<a>` tag, `<img>` requires an attribute, in this case `src`. The `src` attribute stands for source and communicates secondary information to your browser that identifies and locates the image. 

The following element pulls in an image located in the same folder as the `.html` file:

	<img src="scream.jpeg"/>

The same rules apply here as with the `href` tag: if the image is not located in the same folder as the document you are writing in, the image will not be found by the browser. If the browser cannot find an image resource, you will see a broken image icon, such as this one from Chrome:

![Chrome broken image icon](broken.png)

## Activity

Download and save an image from the web, or move an image from your computer into the same folder as your `index.html` file. 

Tip: Give the file a simple name. Also, the name **can not** have spaces.

Using the code above as a reference, add that image into your `index.html` file, re-save the file, and re-open or refresh the page in your browser. You image should now appear on the page.

## What type of tag is the `<img>` tag? 

The `<img>` is a void tag.
