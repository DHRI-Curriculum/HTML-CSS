# Conventions

As we’ve gone through the different components of creating a webpage, you likely have noticed some conventions or industry standards for creating a webpage using HTML. 

**Any guesses?**

## Let's outline them:
<p>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Some tags are self-closing, while others require a closing tag.</strong> Self-closing tags are called void tags, and are generally self-closing because you wouldn't need or want to add another element within a tag. </li>
        <li> <strong>Use lower case.</strong> There is no techical reason to do this, but it is good practice because it makes it easier to scan code. </li>
        <li> <strong>Your code should be nested.</strong> There is no technical reason for this either—blank space has no meaning in html— however, this also makes it easier to scan the code quickly, which is particularly helpful when you run into errors! </li>
    </ul>
</p>

With respect to points 2 and 3, it is good to develop habits that keep with these conventions now, in case you find yourself in a professional coding environment in the future.
