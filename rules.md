# Rule sets

CSS is based on rules. Rule sets look like this:

```
h1 {
	color: orange;
	font-style: italic;
}
```

This rule applies to all `<h1>` tags, and changes their font style and display. The lines within the braces `{ }` are called "selectors," and they change the formatting of the elements in the HTML document. Each selector ends in a semicolon (`;`). 

## Activity 
Copy and paste the CSS above into your `style.css` file and re-save the file. Then open or refresh your `index.html` file in your browser and see what happens.  

<strong>What are some other selectors you might set for different HTML elements?</strong>
