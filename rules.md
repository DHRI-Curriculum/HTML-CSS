# Rule sets

CSS is based on rules. Rule sets look like this:

```
h1 {
	display: inline;
    font-family: sans-serif;
    font-style: normal;
    font-weight: 700;
}
```

This rule applies to all `<h1>` tags, and changes the font style and display type. The lines within the braces `{ }` are called "selectors," and they change the formatting of elements in the HTML document. Each selector ends in a semicolon (`;`). 

## Activity 
Copy and paste the CSS above into your `style.css` file and re-save the file. Then open or refresh your `index.html` file in your browser and see what happens.  

What are some other selectors you might set for different HTML elements?
