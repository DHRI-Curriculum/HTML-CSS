# Activity: Style your Course Site!

Using the CSS basics we've just reviewed, and the list of selectors found on the [Selectors page](selectors.md) the [Resource page](resource.md), give your course site some styling.

We encourage you to use an external stylesheet with classes and IDs to style particular aspects of your site more specifically, but feel free to also play around with inline and internal styling if desired. 

<p>
	<h1> Challenges: </h1>
	<ul>
		<li> Change the color and size of your heading test. </li>
		<li> Change the font of your paragraph text. </li>
		<li> Change the background color of your navigation bar or menu. </li>
		<li> Center your image on your page. </li>
	</ul>
</p>

<strong>Reminder</strong> that after creating a stylesheet, you must link it to your HTML document. You can do so with the `<link>` tag:

	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
	
This will tell your HTML document to use styles from the text file named `style.css` in the same folder.
