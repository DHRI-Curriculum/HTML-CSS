# Conventions

As weâ€™ve gone through the different components of creating a webpage, you have likely picked up on some conventions or industry standards for creating a webpage using HTML. However, before proceeding, let's outline them.

<p>
    <ul>
        <li> Some <strong>tags</strong> are self-closing, while others require a closing tag. Self-closing tags are called void tags, and are generally self-closing because you wouldn't need or want to add another element within a tag. </li>
        <li> <strong>Use lower case.</strong> There is no techical reason to do this, but it is good practice because it makes it easier to scan code. </li>
        <li> <strong>Your code should be nested.</strong> There is no technical reason for this either - blank space has no meaning in html; however, this also makes it easier to scan the code quickly - which is particularly helpful when you run into errors! </li>
    </ul>
</p>

With respect to points 2 and 3, it is good to develop habits that keep with these conventions now, in case you find yourself in a professional codeing environment in the future.
