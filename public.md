# Making Your Website Public

Great job! Now you have an AMAZING website *stuck* on your computer where no one else can find it or view it. How do you get your website onto the Internet so it can be shared? 

The basic answer is FTP - but what is FTP, how does it work, and how can I use it to get my website on the Internet? 

FTP means **file transfer protocol** and in short, is the method used to transfer files from your computer (*a client*) to another computer called a server, and back again. This is something we do ALL THE TIME, but we refer to it as 'uploading' and 'downloading'. 

In order to transfer your website files (also called your website's directory) to a server you will need:
- and internet connection
- FTP client

In order to do this, you'll need to download an FTP Client, some knowledge of the command line, and a hosting service.
